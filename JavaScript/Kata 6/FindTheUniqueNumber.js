/*
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55

tâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:
Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
Find The Unique
